# What is TecraCoin

[TecraCoin](https://tecra.space) is open source cryptocurrency developed mainly by Tecra. It focuses on fast transactions and reliable network with low transaction fees. TecraCoin is circulating medium on [Tecra fundraising platform](https://tecra.space) which enables tokenization of high-tech projects.

Tokenization process is decentralised and is fully compatible with Omni Layer asset platform.

TecraCoin developed and utilizes [Merkle Tree Proofs (MTP)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.03588.pdf) as its Proof-of-Work algorithm which aims to be memory-hard with fast verification and short proofs.

## Running with Docker

If you are already familiar with Docker, then running TecraCoin with Docker might be the easier method for you. To run TecraCoin using this method, first install [Docker](https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community). After this, you may continue with the following instructions.

Please note that we currently donâ€˜t support the GUI when running with Docker. Therefore, you can only use RPC (via HTTP or the `tecracoin-cli` utility) to interact with TecraCoin via this method.

1. Pull our latest official Docker image:

    ```sh
    docker pull tecracoin/tecranode-mainnet
    ```

2. Start TecraCoin daemon:

    ```sh
    docker run --detach --name tecracoind tecracoin/tecranode-mainnet
    ```

3. View current block count (this might take a while since the daemon needs to find other nodes and download blocks first):

    ```sh
    docker exec tecracoind tecracoin-cli getblockcount
    ```

4. View connected nodes:

    ```sh
    docker exec tecracoind tecracoin-cli getpeerinfo
    ```

5. Stop daemon:

    ```sh
    docker stop tecracoind
    ```

6. Backup wallet:

    ```sh
    docker cp tecracoind:/home/tecracoind/.tecracoin/wallet.dat .
    ```

7. Start daemon again:

    ```sh
    docker start tecracoind
    ```

### Build

1. Clone the source:

    make
    ```

3. It is recommended to build and run the unit tests:

    ```sh
    make check
    ```
