#### Premine & founders' reward

Prize for mining first block(21mln TCR, 10% of all coins) is considered `premine` and goes to founders.

During first 4 years of running network, prize for every new block except premine is split between miners, founders and masternodes, in following way:

- 55% - miner reward
- 10% - dev team reward
- 20% - society projects reward
- 15% - masternodes reward

After 4 years, whole reward for block will be split between miners and masternodes in following way:

- 70% - miner reward
- 30% - masternodes reward

**TODO**: explain how fixed prize of 15TCR relates to lower prizes after every halving
